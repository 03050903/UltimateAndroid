CommonLibs of Android Development
===================================

A fast way to develop Android apps.

The lib contains many feature like View Injection,ORM,Asynchronous Http and Image,User scenario testing,etc.And it will
be added by more feature in the future.

The CommonLibs use many opensource program and I am very grateful to the author of them.
The opensource program which I use:

1.JakeWharton's [Butter Knife][1] for View Injection.

2.loopj's [Asynchronous Http Client for Android][2].

3.nostra13's [Universal Image Loader for Android][3]

4.greenrobot's [greenDAO][4]

5.pardom's [ActiveAndroid][5]

6.JakeWharton's [DiskLruCache][6]

7.Issacw0ng's [SwipeBackLayout][7]

8.[google-gson][8]

9.RobotiumTech's [robotium][9]

If there's anything I forgot to mention,I would be very appreciated for helping me notice it.

And there are also many useful feature like TripleDes Utils,WebViewUtils,Md5Utils etc.
